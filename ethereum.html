        <h3>Ethereum</h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="content my-3">
            Ethereum is often referred to as the second most popular cryptocurrency, after Bitcoin. But unlike
            Bitcoin—and most other virtual currencies—Ethereum is intended to be much more than simply a medium of
            exchange or a store of value. Instead, Ethereum calls itself a decentralized computing network built on
            blockchain technology. Let’s unpack what that means.</p>
        <p class="headings">How Does Ethereum Work?</p>
        <p class="content">
            Like all cryptocurrencies, Ethereum works on the basis of a blockchain network. A blockchain is a
            decentralized, distributed public ledger where all transactions are verified and recorded. <br> <br>
            It’s distributed in the sense that everyone participating in the Ethereum network holds an identical copy of
            this ledger, letting them see all past transactions. It’s decentralized in that the network isn’t operated
            or managed by any centralized entity—instead, it’s managed by all of the distributed ledger holders. <br>
            <br>
            Blockchain transactions use cryptography to keep the network secure and verify transactions. People use
            computers to “mine,” or solve complex mathematical equations that confirm each transaction on the network
            and add new blocks to the blockchain that is at the heart of the system. Participants are rewarded with
            cryptocurrency tokens. For the Ethereum system, these tokens are called Ether (ETH). <br> <br>
            Ether can be used to buy and sell goods and services, like Bitcoin. It’s also seen rapid gains in price over
            recent years, making it a de-facto speculative investment. But what’s unique about Ethereum is that users
            can build applications that “run” on the blockchain like software “runs” on a computer. These applications
            can store and transfer personal data or handle complex financial transactions. <br> <br>
            “Ethereum is different from Bitcoin in that the network can perform computations as part of the mining
            process,” says Ken Fromm, director of education and development at the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. “This
            basic computational capability turns a store of value and medium of exchange into a decentralized global
            computing engine and openly verifiable data store.” <br> <br>
        </p>
        <p class="headings">Ethereum vs Bitcoin</p>
        <p class="content">
            Bitcoin’s primary use is as a virtual currency and store of value. Ether also works as a virtual currency
            and store of value, but the decentralized Ethereum network makes it possible to create and run applications,
            smart contracts and other transactions on the network. Bitcoin doesn’t offer these functions. It’s only used
            as a currency and store of value. <br> <br>

            Ethereum also processes transactions more quickly. “New blocks are validated on the Bitcoin network once
            every 10 minutes while new blocks are validated on the Ethereum network once every 12 seconds,” says Gary
            DeWaal, chair of Katten’s Financial Markets and Regulation group. And future developments could speed up
            Ethereum transactions even more, he notes. <br> <br>

            Last, there is no limit on the number of potential Ether tokens while Bitcoin will release no more than 21
            million coins. <br> <br>

        </p>
        <p class="headings">How to Buy Ethereum:</p>
        <p class="content">
            It’s a common misconception to people who are new to the Ethereum network. You don’t buy Ethereum
            itself—that’s the network. Instead, you buy Ether and then use it on the Ethereum network. Given Ethereum’s
            popularity, it’s very easy to buy Ether: <br> <br>

            1) <b> Pick a cryptocurrency exchange.</b> Crypto exchanges and trading platforms are used to buy and sell
            different cryptocurrencies. Coinbase, Binance and Kraken are a few of the larger exchanges. If you are just
            interested in purchasing the most common coins like Ether and Bitcoin, you could also use an online
            brokerage like Robinhood or SoFi. Be prepared to pay some amount of trading or processing fees almost
            universally. <br> <br>


            2) <b> Deposit fiat money. </b> You’ll need to deposit cash, like dollars, in your trading platform or link
            your bank account or debit card to fund purchases of Ether. <br> <br>


            3) <b> Buy Ether.</b> Once you’ve funded your account, you can use the money to purchase Ether at the
            current Ethereum price along with other assets. Once the coins are in your account, you could hold them,
            sell them or trade them for other cryptocurrencies in the future. Keep in mind you may incur taxes whenever
            you sell or trade cryptocurrencies. <br> <br>


            4) <b> Use a wallet. </b> While you could store the Ether in your trading platform’s default digital wallet,
            this can be a security risk. If someone hacks the exchange, they could easily steal your coins. Another
            option is to transfer coins you aren’t planning on selling or trading soon into another digital wallet or a
            cold wallet that’s not connected to the internet for safety. <br> <br>
